## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**I don't advise to buy or invest in crypto. I'm not a financial advisor. And for God's sake, please don't think that this app is supposed to make you rich or something. It's just a simple conversion tool that tries to minimize withdrawal fees for your crypto. It might be not the most accurate tool and there might be bugs. Double check actual conversion rates on exchanges.**

**USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK!**

## Foreword

Just a small introduction why this tool was created.

[Korbit](https://www.korbit.co.kr/) exchange has quite high fees when you withdraw crypto, especially for BTC.
To withdraw BTC you have to pay 0.001 BTC (as for 2022-07-01). And we all want to withdraw our crypto from exchange as quickly as possible. Because as you know **not your keys not your coins**. But paying 0.001 BTC every time you try to move 0.005 BTC is quite a hit, basically 20% fee, oof that hurts.

That's why I've been investigating how to get my coins off the exchange with as small loss as possible.
I found out that if you buy other *intermediate* coin that will be used for conversion purpose only and sell it on [sideshift.ai](https://sideshift.ai/), you can minimize your loss.

You don't keep this *intermediate* coin. You buy it, withdraw from Korbit and sell it on sideshift.ai for your target coin moving it to your wallet.

### Why Korbit as main exchange

You might wonder why would you even use Korbit, if there are so many cool exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, you name it.
The thing is, all these exchanges are not available in South Korea, you can only use about 4 approved exchanges and Korbit is one of them.

### Why sideshift.ai as exchange for conversion

As it was said, there isn't much choice in South Korea when it comes to crypto exchanges.
I guess you can try and use something like Kraken and transfer you coins there, then convert them and withdraw from Kraken, but to send to
Kraken you have to abide Korbit Travel Rule and wait for Kraken account approval on Korbit account.

You also have to follow Travel Rule for your own wallets, but applying for screening for wallets are more straightforward in my opinion.

sideshift.ai is quite easy to use and has no KYC (Know You Customer) policy.
